# Infectious Disease Modelling
This repository is about Computing Math 2 group assignment of UM FCSIT. The project focuses on utilizing compartmental models (SEIR, MSEIRS, and MSVEIRS) to analyze the spread of infectious diseases and their impact on society.

## Problem Statements

1. How do the susceptible rate, transmission rate, infectious rate, and recovery rate of a disease affect society?
2. To what extent are safety measures (such as social distancing, mask-wearing, lockdowns, and vaccination) effective in reducing disease transmission and controlling outbreaks?
3. What is the influence of maternally-derived immunity on the dynamics of infectious diseases?

Please refer to the report and presentation slides for detailed information on the models used and the analysis conducted.
